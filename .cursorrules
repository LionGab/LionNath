# Cursor 2.0 Rules for LionNath Project

## ðŸ†• Cursor 2.0 Specific Instructions

### Agent Mode Guidelines

- When using Agent Mode, always show planned steps before execution
- Ask for confirmation before deleting files
- Provide clear summaries of terminal commands before running
- Validate changes before applying
- Use incremental approach for complex tasks

### Multi-file Operations

- When editing multiple files, show preview of all changes
- Group related changes together
- Explain the relationship between file modifications
- Ensure consistency across all edited files

### Context Awareness

- Always consider the full project structure
- Reference existing patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistency with established codebase
- Use Shadow Workspace for better understanding

## Project Context

This is a React Native application with TypeScript, focused on personal development and daily interactions.

**Tech Stack:**

- React Native 0.73+
- TypeScript 5.x
- Supabase (Backend)
- React Navigation
- Custom theme system (Bubblegum Design)

## Code Style & Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Prefer functional components with hooks over class components
- Use explicit typing, avoid `any` types
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Always use semicolons
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas in ES5 style

## File Structure

- Components in `src/components/`
- Screens in `src/screens/`
- Services in `src/services/`
- Utilities in `src/utils/`
- Theme configuration in `src/theme/`
- Custom hooks in `src/hooks/`

## Best Practices

1. Always add proper error handling
2. Use async/await instead of promises when possible
3. Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
4. Keep components small and focused (Single Responsibility)
5. Use custom hooks to extract reusable logic
6. Implement proper TypeScript types and interfaces
7. Follow React Native best practices for performance
8. Use memoization (useMemo, useCallback) when appropriate

## Import Order

1. React & React Native imports
2. Third-party libraries
3. Local components
4. Utilities & helpers
5. Types & interfaces
6. Styles & assets

## Naming Conventions

- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Files: camelCase for utilities (e.g., `helpers.ts`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Functions: camelCase
- Interfaces/Types: PascalCase with `I` prefix for interfaces

## Testing

- Write unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Add integration tests for critical flows
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Mock external dependencies

## Git Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code style changes (formatting)
- refactor: Code refactoring
- test: Adding or updating tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks

## Security

- Never commit sensitive data (.env files)
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before rendering
- Follow LGPD/GDPR guidelines for user data

## Performance

- Lazy load components when possible
- Optimize images and assets
- Use FlatList for long lists (not ScrollView)
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Profile performance regularly

## AI Assistant Guidelines

- Suggest TypeScript solutions
- Provide complete, working code examples
- Include error handling
- Add helpful comments
- Follow project structure
- Consider React Native specifics
- Suggest performance optimizations
- Maintain consistency with existing code
